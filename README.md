## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This repository contains the architecture and implementation work based on the **"Jenkins From Zero to Hero"** course available on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/jenkins-from-zero-to-hero/learn/lecture/12999622#overview).

Throughout this lab, I have applied various DevOps tools and concepts to build a robust CI/CD pipeline. The work is structured across multiple components, with detailed notes and configurations available for each tool used.
